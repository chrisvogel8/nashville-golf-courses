    <h2>Course Details</h2>
    <p>Richland's 18-hole course plays to a par 71 and is known for its classic, understated design that rewards strategic thinking over raw power. The tight, tree-lined fairways demand accuracy off the tee, and the small, undulating greens make approach play and putting crucial to a good score. It's a course that reveals more of its character with every round you play.</p>
    <h2>The Signature Hole</h2>
    <p>The par-4 9th hole is a demanding dogleg right that serves as a fitting conclusion to the front nine. A large oak tree guards the inside corner of the dogleg, forcing golfers to decide between a safe layup and an aggressive cut over the tree. The approach plays uphill to a well-bunkered green that slopes away from the golfer, making it one of the most difficult greens on the course to hold.</p>

The club also features tennis courts and a swimming pool, making it a full-service private club for families throughout the Nashville area.</p>
